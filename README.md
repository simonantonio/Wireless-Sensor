Wireless Sensor Host Board
=========

This is a board used to implement wireless reporting of various sensors

Suggested Sensor Modules
---  

 - DHT22 - Temperature & Humidity  
 - TSOP4838 - IR Sensor (32khz carrier)  
 - Photo Resistor - Basic Light Levels  
 - Pulse Sensing - For use with hall effect sensors or weather stations such as [Spark Fun's Weather Station](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942)
 - BMP180 - Barometer & Temperature
 - Battery Voltage Monitoring
 
Results can then be transmitted to a receiver using a NRF24L01+ 

The board aims to be a low power long term sensor platform, potentially being powered from a LIPO battery directly or using a step down module such as the [Pololu Step Down Voltage Regulator](http://www.pololu.com/product/2097)

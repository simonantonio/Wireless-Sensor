Project Notes
=========

This is a very basic document containing thoughts, ideas and some notes on the wireless sensor board  
   
You will need 
----
 - ISP programmer
 - Soldering Skills (there is a reasonable amount of SMD parts sorry)
 - Parts (You should be able to get a decent amount from ebay)
 - Programming Skills. 
 
Notes
-----
Feel free to use the Arduino IDE with your ISP programmer,   
I suggest the [USBtinyISP](https://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp) by adafruit
 
Project will be based fairly strongly on my experience with arduino. But will function as a standalone. 
 
TODO
----
Write the damn program.  
Setup a base station  
Debug  
Test Hardware  
Get PCB  - in progress, ordered intial prototypes on 5th November 2014  
Get Parts - in progress, ordered several parts from ebay. Need aditional minerals (or funds) to order more bits and pieces  
Write proper documentation and instructions  
Improve board layout (ideally smaller than 5x5)  
Add a through hole component version of the board to make life easier  
  
  
??  
Profit

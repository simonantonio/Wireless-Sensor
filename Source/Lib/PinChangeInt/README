---- DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the PinChangeInt library for the Arduino.

See google code project for latest, bugs and info http://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/
See github for the bleeding edge code: https://github.com/GreyGnome/PinChangeInt
For more information Refer to avr-gcc header files, arduino source and atmega datasheet.

This library was inspired by and derived from "johnboiles" (it seems) 
PCInt Arduino Playground example here: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/PcInt
If you are the original author, please let us know at the google code page

It provides an extension to the interrupt support for arduino by adding pin change interrupts,
giving a way for users to have interrupts drive off of any pin (ATmega328-based Arduinos),
by the Port B, J, and K pins on the Arduino Mega and its ilk, and on the appropriate
ports (including Port A) on the Sanguino and its ilk.  Regarding the MEGA and friends, Cserveny
says: "J is mostly useless, because of the hardware UART...  (many) pins are not connected on the
arduino boards."

---- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------
This library was originally written by Chris J. Kiick, Robot builder and all around geek, who said of it,
	"HI, Yeah, I wrote the original PCint library. It was a bit of a hack and the new one has better
	features.  I intended the code to be freely usable.  Didn't really think about a license.  Feel
	free to use it in your code: I hereby grant you permission."
Thanks, Chris! A hack? I dare say not, if I have taken this any further it's merely by standing on the
shoulders of giants. This library was the best "tutorial" I found on Arduino Pin Change Interrupts
and because of that I decided to continue to maintain and (hopefully) improve it. We, the Arduino
community of robot builders and geeks, owe you a great debt of gratitude for your hack- a hack in
the finest sense.

The library was then picked up by Lex Talionis, who created the Google Code website. We all owe a debt
of thanks to Lex, too, for all his hard work! He is currently the other official maintainer of this
code.

Many thanks to all the contributors who have contributed bug fixes, code, and suggestions
to this project: 

John Boiles and Baziki (who added fixes to PcInt), Maurice Beelen, nms277, Akesson Karlpetter, and
Orly Andico for various fixes to this code, Rob Tillaart for some excellent code reviews and nice
optimizations, Andre' Franken for a good bug report that kept me thinking, cserveny.tamas a special
shout out for providing the MEGA code to PinChangeInt- Thanks!

Many thanks to JRHelbert for fixing the PJ0 and PJ1 interrupt PCMSK1 issue... 06/2014
